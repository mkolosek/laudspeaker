## üî• What makes Laudspeaker cool?

Lauspeaker is the only multi-channel open-source customer messaging workflow software, which is focused on being event triggered, has been built with a visual journey feature from day one and is focused on scalability.

We support email, sms and slack as a channel and have many more channels on our roadmap.

We are planning to build Laudspeaker to work well with the Modern Data Stack, integrating with data warehouses and other services so you can easily import and export data with no fear of lock in or losing control of your data.

## üê• Status

- [ ] Public Alpha: Anyone can sign up over at [laudspeaker.com](https://laudspeaker.com) but go easy on us, there are wrinkles and we're just getting started.
- [x] Public Beta: Stable enough for most non-enterprise use-cases.
- [ ] Public: Production-ready.

We're currently in Public Beta.

## License

**Laudspeaker** is open source and released under the AGPL-3.0 license with the exception of our ee directory (which is currently empty!) but will be under the Laudspeaker Enterprise Edition license.
